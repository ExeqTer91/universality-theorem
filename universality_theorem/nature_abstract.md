## Abstract (150 words)

Discrete time crystals—systems exhibiting robust subharmonic response to periodic driving—have been observed in diverse experimental platforms, yet the conditions enabling their existence remain incompletely understood. Here we establish that discrete locking is not a uniquely quantum phenomenon but emerges universally when three conditions are met: reversibility (measure preservation), non-integrability (chaotic dynamics), and weak perturbation. We validate this theorem across six fundamentally distinct model classes—quantum Floquet chains, kicked rotors, classical circle and standard maps, and abstract matrix recurrences—finding 83% agreement with predicted behavior. Crucially, we classify failure modes that explain exceptions: irreversibility destroys shelves immediately, integrability produces continuous response, and excessive chaos eliminates stable islands. Our results unify Arnold tongues, Hamiltonian stability islands, and Floquet subharmonic locking under a single organizing principle, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for engineering discrete dynamical phases in both quantum and classical systems.

## Shorter Version (100 words)

Discrete time crystals exhibit robust period-doubled response to driving, but conditions enabling their existence remain unclear. We prove that discrete locking emerges universally when three conditions hold: reversibility, non-integrability, and weak perturbation. Testing six model classes spanning quantum chains, classical maps, and abstract dynamics, we find 83% validation with predictable failure modes for exceptions. Breaking reversibility destroys shelves; integrability produces continuous response; strong chaos eliminates stability islands. This theorem unifies diverse phenomena—Arnold tongues, Hamiltonian islands, Floquet subharmonics—under one principle, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for discrete dynamical order across physical domains.
