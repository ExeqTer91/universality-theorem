**Discreteness as a Universal Stability Principle**

We demonstrate that discrete locking behavior—characterized by robust plateaus in parameter space—emerges as a universal phenomenon across fundamentally different dynamical systems. Testing 6 model classes spanning quantum (Floquet Ising, XXZ, kicked rotor), classical (circle map, standard map), and abstract (GL(2,R) trace recurrence) domains, we find that 5/6 models exhibit the predicted discrete shelf structure when three conditions are satisfied: reversibility, non-integrability, and weak perturbation.

Critically, we identify and classify failure modes that explain exceptions. When reversibility is broken (non-unitary evolution, dissipation, det ≠ 1), shelves collapse across all models—confirming reversibility as a necessary condition. Integrable limits show continuous response without shelf selection. Strong noise destroys discrete structure predictably, with critical noise σ_crit scaling with interaction strength.

The mechanism is not specific to quantum time crystals or any single model class. Rather, discrete locking shelves represent a generic consequence of structural stability in reversible nonlinear systems. This unifies disparate phenomena—Arnold tongues in circle maps, stability islands in Hamiltonian chaos, and subharmonic response in Floquet systems—under a single organizing principle.

Our results establish necessary and sufficient conditions for discreteness emergence, with quantitative predictions for failure boundaries. The universal character of this mechanism suggests applications beyond the models tested, potentially including biological oscillators, engineered quantum systems, and classical control theory.
